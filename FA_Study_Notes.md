# **1\. Introduction & The Fundamental Analyst Mindset**

## **1.1 Why Fundamental Analysis (FA) Matters**

**FA drives long-term price movements.** While technical analysis (TA) explains short-term noise and entry/exit timing, the underlying reason a currency trends over weeks and months is almost always macroeconomic. Hedge fund managers, investment bank traders, and institutional desks all anchor their positioning in FA — then use TA to refine entries.

**Key insight:** The typical retail trader watches 15-minute candlestick charts and wonders why their patterns keep failing. The answer is context. If the macro environment is bearish on a currency, no bullish engulfing candle will save you. FA gives you the context that makes TA work.

| Core Principle: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Drivers |
| :---- |
| Short-term price moves → Fear & Greed (sentiment, news reactions, technical levels) |
| Long-term price trends → Fundamentals (interest rates, growth, inflation, trade flows) |
| Insight: Both matter. Sentiment IS a fundamental variable — it directly affects capital flows. |

## **1.2 The Right Mindset: Think Like an Institutional Trader**

* **Long-term outlook:** Think in days, weeks, and months — not minutes. Scalping and day trading ignore the macro picture entirely.

* **Investor mindset:** Ask 'why is capital flowing to/from this currency?' not 'where is the next resistance?'

* **Media literacy:** Watch Bloomberg and CNBC not to trade the news, but to understand the narrative driving markets. The narrative IS the sentiment, and sentiment moves capital.

* **Pattern recognition over time:** Reading financial news feels confusing at first. Consistency compounds — daily exposure builds intuition over months.

**Recommended News & Research Resources:**

* Bloomberg TV / Bloomberg.com — central bank speeches, macro analysis

* CNBC — market sentiment and breaking economic data

* Financial Times (FT.com) — deep macro journalism

* ForexLive.com — real-time forex-specific economic commentary

* Bloomberg Terminal — used by professionals for raw data speed (first-mover advantage)

# **2\. How to Analyse Economic Data**

## **2.1 The Three-Layer Framework**

When any economic number is released, analyse it through three lenses simultaneously:

| Layer | What to Assess & Why |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1\. Absolute Value | Is the number positive or negative? This is the baseline — a negative GDP print is contractionary. Simple but necessary context. |
| 2\. Delta (% Change) | The change relative to the previous period. This is more important than the absolute figure. A country can have positive employment growth but if growth is decelerating, the currency can still fall. |
| 3\. Trend (6–12 months) | Is the data in an uptrend, downtrend, or sideways? A single data point is noise. A trend is signal. Central banks react to trends, not one-off prints. |
| 4\. vs. Expectations | Did it beat or miss analyst consensus? Markets price in expectations. Even a positive number causes a sell-off if it misses forecasts — traders had already bought in anticipation. |

## **2.2 The Expectations Effect — Why 'Good News' Can Be Bearish**

This trips up many beginners. If a currency's employment data comes in at \+150,000 jobs (positive) but expectations were \+200,000 (missed), the currency will **fall**. The market doesn't trade what happened — it trades the delta vs. what it expected to happen.

| Expectations Framework |
| :---- |
| Data BEATS expectations → Currency likely RISES |
| Data MEETS expectations → Minimal reaction (already priced in) |
| Data MISSES expectations → Currency likely FALLS (even if positive in absolute terms) |
| Insight: This is why professional traders study analyst consensus forecasts, not just the data itself. |

## **2.3 Why Context Determines Whether Data Matters**

Not all economic data moves markets equally. Whether a data point matters depends on:

* **Business Cycle Stage:** During late expansion, inflation data dominates. During recession, unemployment data dominates. Read the cycle to know what traders care about.

* **Historical reliability:** Has this indicator predicted economic outcomes accurately over the past 10–50 years?

* **Revision count:** GDP has an advance, preliminary, and final report. The first release (advance) moves markets the most — even though it's least accurate. Markets react to what comes first.

* **Economic size/power:** US Nonfarm Payrolls moves global markets. A small emerging market's employment report does not.

* **Timeliness:** The earlier in the month data is released, the more market-moving. NFP is released in the first week of the month — hence its enormous impact.

* **Media coverage:** Widely followed data moves more. Bloomberg Terminal users get data milliseconds before the public — this is why professional traders have an edge.

# **3\. The Business Cycle — The Context of Everything**

## **3.1 Why the Business Cycle Is the Foundation of FA**

The most critical mistake retail traders make is evaluating economic data in isolation. Every data point must be interpreted through the lens of where we are in the business cycle. The same inflation figure means different things in expansion vs. recession.

| Cycle Phase | What Traders Focus On |
| :---- | :---- |
| Early Expansion | GDP growth, PMI rising, employment improving. Risk appetite increases. Risk currencies (AUD, NZD) rally. Safe havens (JPY, USD) sell off. |
| Late Expansion | Inflation (especially core CPI) becomes the main focus. Markets anticipate rate hikes. High-yield currencies attract carry traders. |
| Peak | Overheating economy. Central banks hiking aggressively. Yield curves flatten or invert. Risk assets begin to wobble. |
| Recession | Unemployment data takes centre stage. Rate cut expectations drive currency weakness. Safe haven flows dominate (JPY, CHF, Gold). |
| Trough / Recovery | Stimulus measures (QE, fiscal spending) kick in. First signs of stabilisation. Early cyclical indicators (PMI, retail sales) watched for green shoots. |

## **3.2 Insight: The Cycle Determines Which Data Is 'In Vogue'**

In late **expansion**: Nobody cares about unemployment (it's low). Everyone obsesses over CPI and when the Fed will hike.

In **recession**: Nobody cares about inflation (it's falling). Everyone watches jobless claims, NFP, and GDP contraction.

| Practical Application |
| :---- |
| Before trading any economic release, ask: 'Does the market currently CARE about this data?' |
| If the Fed is focused on inflation fighting, then CPI releases will be explosive. NFP less so. |
| If the economy is in free-fall, rate cut bets dominate. Inflation data is an afterthought. |
| Insight: Trade the narrative, not just the number. |

# **4\. Key Economic Indicators**

## **4.1 Inflation**

### **Types of Inflation**

| Type | Definition & Significance |
| :---- | :---- |
| Headline Inflation (CPI) | Overall Consumer Price Index. Includes food and energy — highly volatile. Used for headline news but less useful for policy decisions. |
| Core Inflation (Core CPI) | Strips out food and energy prices. The Fed's preferred inflation measure. More stable and more predictive of long-term price trends. |
| PPI (Producer Price Index) | Measures prices producers receive for their output. PPI is a leading indicator of CPI — rising producer costs eventually flow to consumers. |
| Deflation | Falling price levels. Sounds good but is economically dangerous: consumers delay purchases expecting further price drops, leading to economic stagnation. |
| Stagflation | Simultaneous high inflation \+ high unemployment. Central banks cannot raise rates (kills jobs) or cut rates (worsens inflation). Near-impossible to fix. |
| Hyperinflation | Runaway inflation (e.g. Zimbabwe 2008, Weimar Germany). Destroys currency value and erodes savings completely. |
| Disinflation | Inflation rate is positive but slowing. Not deflation. Economy still growing but momentum is cooling. |

### **How Central Banks Respond to Inflation**

* **Raise interest rates:** Increases cost of borrowing → less consumer spending and business investment → reduces money circulating in economy → cools inflation.

* **Increase reserve requirements:** Banks must hold more reserves, reducing lendable funds.

* **Open market operations (OMO):** Sell government bonds → drains liquidity from market → reduces money supply.

* **Fiscal policy (government):** Raise taxes, cut spending → reduces aggregate demand.

* **Supply-side policies:** Invest in productivity and technology → increases output without raising prices. Does not harm trade balance unlike rate hikes.

| Currency Implication of Inflation |
| :---- |
| Rising inflation → Central bank likely to RAISE rates → Currency APPRECIATES |
| Falling inflation / deflation → Central bank likely to CUT rates → Currency DEPRECIATES |
| BUT: If inflation is too high and destroying purchasing power, foreign investors may AVOID the country → Currency DEPRECIATES |
| Insight: The net effect on currency depends on whether rate hike expectations outweigh the negative sentiment from purchasing power erosion. |

## **4.2 Employment**

### **Key Employment Metrics**

* **Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP):** Monthly US jobs report. Released first Friday of each month — highest market-moving impact of any regular US data release. Covers all non-farm sectors.

* **Unemployment Rate:** Percentage of the active labour force that is jobless and actively job-seeking. Important caveat: discouraged workers (gave up searching) are EXCLUDED — so the rate often understates true unemployment.

* **Part-Time Employment:** Rising part-time work can be an early recession warning signal. Companies uncertain about the future hire part-time (lower commitment, lower cost) before laying off full-timers.

* **Jobless Claims (Weekly):** Initial jobless claims are a high-frequency, real-time indicator of labour market health. Very timely.

### **Why Employment Is Political — and Why That Matters**

Employment data is one of the most politically sensitive economic metrics. Governments face direct electoral consequences when unemployment rises. This creates two key risks:

* **Data manipulation:** Governments can influence how labour statistics are computed (e.g., changing participation rate definitions, seasonal adjustments). Always consider the political environment when interpreting official numbers.

* **Lagging nature:** NFP is a lagging indicator. By the time mass layoffs show up in the data, the recession may already be months old. Use leading indicators (PMI, jobless claims) to anticipate moves before NFP confirms them.

| Insight: Don't Trade NFP Blindly |
| :---- |
| The knee-jerk reaction to NFP often reverses within hours. The initial spike reflects algo trading on the headline number. |
| Professional approach: Wait for the revision context, average hourly earnings data (wage inflation), and participation rate — then trade the sustained move. |
| Average Hourly Earnings within the NFP report is increasingly watched as a proxy for wage-driven inflation — potentially more important than the headline jobs number in a high-inflation environment. |

## **4.3 GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**

### **Understanding GDP**

GDP measures the total market value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period. It is the broadest measure of economic health.

| GDP Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Nominal GDP | Raw output × current prices. Can rise simply because prices increased, not because more was actually produced. Misleading in inflationary periods. |
| Real GDP | Output × base-year (constant) prices. Removes inflation effect. The true measure of whether an economy is growing in real terms. |
| GDP Per Capita | GDP divided by population. Better for cross-country comparisons — a country with 1 billion people will always have higher total GDP than one with 10 million, regardless of living standards. |
| Debt-to-GDP | Total government debt relative to GDP. High ratio signals fiscal stress. Countries with high debt-to-GDP often compensate with higher interest rates to attract foreign capital. |

### **The GDP Formula — and What Can Move It**

GDP \= Consumption (C) \+ Investment (I) \+ Government Spending (G) \+ Net Exports (X \- M)

* **Consumption:** Consumer spending. The largest component in most developed economies (US consumption \= \~70% of GDP). Driven by employment, wages, consumer confidence.

* **Investment:** Business spending on equipment, buildings, R\&D. Indicator of business confidence and forward-looking growth.

* **Government Spending:** Fiscal stimulus injects directly into GDP. That's why governments ramp up infrastructure spending during recessions.

* **Net Exports:** Trade surplus adds to GDP; trade deficit subtracts. That's why currency strength matters — a strong currency makes exports expensive and hurts GDP.

### **GDP Limitations**

* Does not include the underground/informal economy

* Does not count self-produced goods and services (growing your own food, home repairs)

* Does not measure second-hand market transactions

* Does not capture inequality — a country can have high GDP while most citizens remain poor

| Insight: GDP Advance Report vs. Final Report |
| :---- |
| Advance GDP (released \~1 month after quarter ends) → Biggest market move |
| Preliminary GDP (1 month later) → Moderate reaction if significant revision |
| Final GDP (another month later) → Often ignored unless dramatically different |
| Trade the advance report. That's where the volatility lives. |

## **4.4 Trade Balance**

### **Trade Surplus vs. Trade Deficit**

Trade balance \= Exports − Imports

| Position | Implication |
| :---- | :---- |
| Trade Surplus (X \> M) | More money flows INTO the country from foreign buyers. Generally currency-positive. Signals competitive industries and strong export demand. |
| Trade Deficit (X \< M) | More money flows OUT to pay for imports. Generally currency-negative in isolation. However, the US runs persistent deficits and USD remains strong — because of capital account inflows. |

### **Current Account vs. Capital Account**

* **Current Account:** Trade in goods and services. What most people think of as 'trade balance.'

* **Capital Account (Financial Account):** Flow of investments, stocks, bonds, FDI. A country can run a trade deficit but attract so much investment capital that its currency remains strong (see: USA).

| Insight: Why the US Can Run Trade Deficits Forever (Almost) |
| :---- |
| The US current account deficit is offset by massive capital account inflows. Foreign investors buy US Treasuries, US equities, and US real estate — all of which require buying USD first. |
| As long as the US financial market remains the world's most attractive destination for capital, the USD will remain structurally supported despite trade deficits. |
| This is the 'exorbitant privilege' of being the world's reserve currency issuer. |

## **4.5 PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index)**

* **Manufacturing PMI:** Surveys factory purchasing managers on orders, output, employment. Above 50 \= expansion; below 50 \= contraction.

* **Services PMI (Non-Manufacturing PMI):** Same concept for the services sector. In most developed economies, services represent 60–80% of GDP, so this often matters more than manufacturing PMI.

* **Composite PMI:** Combines both. A useful real-time snapshot of overall business conditions.

| Why PMI Is Valuable |
| :---- |
| PMI is a LEADING indicator — it comes out early in the month, covering the prior month's conditions. |
| It's forward-looking: purchasing managers increase orders in anticipation of future demand. |
| A PMI crossing above or below 50 for the first time is a significant signal of trend change. |
| Insight: PMI is arguably more useful than GDP for short-to-medium-term forex trading because it's timelier. |

# **5\. Central Banks & Monetary Policy**

## **5.1 The Role of Central Banks**

Central banks are the most powerful actors in currency markets. Their decisions on interest rates and money supply are the primary driver of long-term exchange rate trends. Understanding what they're thinking — before they act — is the closest thing to an edge that exists in macro trading.

| Central Bank | Country / Region |
| :---- | :---- |
| Federal Reserve (Fed) | United States |
| European Central Bank (ECB) | Eurozone (19 countries) |
| Bank of Japan (BoJ) | Japan |
| Bank of England (BoE) | United Kingdom |
| Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) | Australia |
| Swiss National Bank (SNB) | Switzerland |
| People's Bank of China (PBoC) | China |

## **5.2 Monetary Policy Tools**

### **Interest Rates**

The **primary tool**. Raising rates → currency appreciation (higher yield attracts foreign capital). Cutting rates → currency depreciation.

### **Fed Funds Rate vs. Discount Rate**

* **Fed Funds Rate:** The rate at which commercial banks lend their excess reserves to each other overnight. Set by the FOMC. This is the benchmark rate.

* **Discount Rate:** The rate at which the Fed lends directly to commercial banks ('lender of last resort'). Always higher than fed funds rate — the Fed wants banks to lend to each other first.

### **Open Market Operations (OMO)**

* **Buying bonds (QE):** Fed injects cash into the banking system → money supply increases → interest rates fall → currency weakens.

* **Selling bonds (QT):** Fed drains cash from the banking system → money supply decreases → interest rates rise → currency strengthens.

### **Reserve Requirements**

The minimum fraction of deposits that banks must hold in reserve. Increasing reserve requirements reduces lendable funds — a contractionary tool. Rarely used in developed economies but common in China (PBoC).

### **Quantitative Easing (QE) / Quantitative Tightening (QT)**

* **QE:** Large-scale asset purchases (mostly government bonds) by the central bank. Pumps money into the financial system when interest rates are already near zero ('zero lower bound'). USD-negative.

* **QT (balance sheet reduction):** Allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting (or actively selling). USD-positive — reduces money supply.

## **5.3 Hawkish vs. Dovish — The Language of Central Banks**

| Stance | Meaning & Currency Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Hawkish | Biased toward raising interest rates. Signals concern about inflation overheating. Currency BULLISH — higher rates attract capital. |
| Dovish | Biased toward cutting interest rates or maintaining accommodation. Signals concern about economic weakness or unemployment. Currency BEARISH. |
| Neutral / Data-dependent | No clear bias. Will react based on incoming data. Currency impact depends entirely on what data comes in next. |

| Insight: Trade the Shift, Not the Stance |
| :---- |
| A hawkish central bank that's about to turn dovish is a massive short opportunity for that currency. |
| A dovish central bank showing the first hints of hawkishness is a massive long opportunity. |
| The biggest currency moves come from PIVOTS — changes in central bank direction. |
| Watch for language shifts in central bank statements: 'patient' → 'data-dependent' → 'ready to act' is a hawkish progression. |
| Read the FOMC minutes and ECB press conferences. The subtext matters as much as the rate decision itself. |

## **5.4 The Fed Funds Futures — Predicting Future Rate Decisions**

Professional traders use Fed Funds Futures contracts to gauge market-implied probability of future rate hikes or cuts.

Formula: Contract price \= 100 − Expected Fed Funds Rate

* If fed funds rate is 5%, futures trade at \~95.00

* If traders expect a rate CUT, they BUY futures (price rises)

* If traders expect a rate HIKE, they SELL futures (price falls)

**CME FedWatch Tool:** Free tool that converts futures prices into probability percentages for each FOMC meeting outcome. Essential bookmark for FA traders.

# **6\. Fiscal Policy**

## **6.1 Fiscal vs. Monetary Policy**

| Factor | Monetary Policy | Fiscal Policy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Controlled by | Central Bank (independent) | Government (Treasury/Finance Ministry) |
| Primary Tools | Interest rates, OMO, QE/QT, reserve ratios | Tax rates, government spending |
| Expansionary Form | Cut rates, buy bonds (QE) | Cut taxes, increase government spending |
| Contractionary Form | Raise rates, sell bonds (QT) | Raise taxes, reduce government spending |
| Speed of Effect | Relatively fast (rate decisions immediate) | Slow — legislative process, implementation lag |
| Currency Impact | Direct and immediate | Indirect and gradual |

## **6.2 How Governments Fund Fiscal Spending**

* **Tax revenue:** Primary source. Income taxes, corporate taxes, VAT/sales tax.

* **Government bonds:** Issuing short-term (T-bills), medium-term (T-notes), and long-term (T-bonds) debt. These are bought by domestic and foreign investors — creating capital inflows into the country.

* **Foreign grants and aid:** Minor in developed economies.

* **Reserve drawdowns:** Using saved foreign exchange reserves accumulated during better times.

| Insight: Bond Markets and Currency |
| :---- |
| When a government issues bonds to fund spending, it must attract buyers with competitive yields. |
| Higher bond yields → higher interest rates → currency appreciates (capital inflows to buy bonds). |
| However, massive debt issuance can also signal fiscal instability → currency depreciates (loss of confidence). |
| This is the fine line that bond traders walk — and why credit ratings matter. |

# **7\. Currency-Specific Fundamentals**

## **7.1 What Drives Any Currency — Universal Factors**

* **Interest rate differential:** The \#1 driver of long-term exchange rates. Capital flows toward higher yields.

* **Growth differential:** Countries growing faster attract more investment. Higher GDP growth → stronger currency.

* **Inflation differential:** High inflation erodes purchasing power → currency weakness.

* **Political and economic stability:** Investors demand a 'stability premium.' Unstable countries see capital flight.

* **Current account position:** Trade surpluses support the currency; deficits create structural selling pressure.

* **Central bank credibility:** If markets trust the central bank to control inflation, the currency commands a premium.

* **Reserve currency status:** USD, EUR, JPY, GBP benefit from constant global demand for reserve purposes.

* **Risk sentiment:** During risk-off, safe havens rise. During risk-on, high-yield and commodity currencies outperform.

## **7.2 USD — US Dollar**

### **Structural Characteristics**

* World's primary reserve currency — \~60% of global forex reserves held in USD

* Commodities (oil, gold, copper) priced in USD — commodity price movements directly affect USD demand

* Most liquid currency — tightest spreads, deepest market

* **Safe haven status:** During crises, global investors flee to USD (despite US being the source of many crises). This is the paradox of the reserve currency.

* Major trading partners: China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany

### **Key Insight: Dollar Smile Theory**

The USD strengthens in TWO scenarios:

* **Risk-off:** Global panic → safe haven flows → USD up

* **Strong US growth:** US outperforming globally → rate hike expectations → USD up

USD weakens in the middle — when global growth is moderate and the US is neither the best nor worst performer.

## **7.3 EUR — Euro**

* Used by 20 countries — economic diversity makes ECB's job extremely complex

* Second largest reserve currency — deep, liquid market

* Inversely correlated to USD most of the time (EURUSD is the most traded pair globally)

* Seen as a risk currency — tends to sell off during global crises

* **Key driver:** German economic data (PMI, ZEW sentiment, industrial production) moves EUR most

* Major trading partners: US, China, UK, Switzerland

| Insight: ECB Complexity vs. Fed |
| :---- |
| The Fed sets one interest rate for one economy. |
| The ECB sets one interest rate for 20 very different economies — from Germany's export powerhouse to Southern European debt-laden nations. |
| This structural tension creates persistent EUR volatility during sovereign debt crises (e.g., 2010–2012 eurozone debt crisis). |
| Watch for 'fragmentation' risk — spreads widening between German bunds and Italian BTPs signal stress in the eurozone system. |

## **7.4 JPY — Japanese Yen**

* Third most traded currency globally

* **Safe haven:** During risk-off, JPY typically strengthens — even though Japan has massive debt. This is due to Japan's massive net foreign asset position and repatriation flows.

* **Export-oriented economy:** BoJ intervenes more frequently than most central banks to prevent excessive JPY strength (which hurts exporters)

* Historically ultra-low interest rates — primary funding currency for carry trades

* Major trading partners: US, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong

### **The Yen Carry Trade**

Borrow cheaply in JPY (low interest rate) → invest in higher-yielding currencies (AUD, NZD, EM currencies) → profit from the interest rate differential. During risk-off events, carry trades unwind rapidly → JPY surges as traders buy back JPY to repay loans.

## **7.5 Commodity Currencies — AUD, CAD, NZD**

These currencies are strongly correlated to the commodities their countries export:

| Currency | Key Commodity / Export Driver |
| :---- | :---- |
| AUD (Australian Dollar) | Iron ore, coal, gold. China is Australia's biggest trading partner — AUD is essentially a proxy for Chinese economic health. |
| CAD (Canadian Dollar) | Oil (WTI crude). Oil price rises → CAD strengthens. US is Canada's dominant trade partner — USDCAD heavily influenced by US growth and oil prices. |
| NZD (New Zealand Dollar) | Dairy products, agricultural commodities. Similar risk profile to AUD. |

| Insight: Commodity Prices as Leading FX Indicators |
| :---- |
| Before you trade AUD, check iron ore futures and Chinese PMI. |
| Before you trade CAD, check WTI crude oil prices and US-Canada trade data. |
| Commodity price moves often PRECEDE the currency move — giving you a leading indicator advantage. |
| This is intermarket analysis in practice. |

# **8\. Risk Sentiment & Capital Flows**

## **8.1 Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Framework**

Sentiment is the immediate transmission mechanism between fundamentals and price. Even if you understand all the economic data perfectly, getting sentiment wrong will blow up trades.

| Environment | Risk-ON | Risk-OFF |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Description | Investors optimistic. Buying riskier assets for higher returns. | Investors fearful. Fleeing to safety regardless of yield. |
| Equities | Rising (S\&P 500, Nikkei, DAX up) | Falling |
| High-yield FX | AUD, NZD, EM currencies UP | AUD, NZD, EM currencies DOWN |
| Safe-haven FX | JPY, CHF, USD weaker | JPY, CHF, USD stronger |
| Gold | Often neutral or slightly up | Strongly UP |
| Bond yields | Rising (selling safe bonds) | Falling (buying safe bonds) |
| Volatility (VIX) | Low (\<15 \= calm) | High (\>30 \= fear) |

## **8.2 Carry Trades and Capital Flows**

A carry trade involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a higher-interest-rate currency to capture the interest rate differential (the 'carry').

* **Example:** Borrow JPY at 0.1% → Buy AUD-denominated assets yielding 4.35% → Profit \= \~4.25% per year (before currency movement).

* **Risk:** If risk-off hits and AUD/JPY falls sharply, the currency loss wipes out years of carry income in days. Carry trades die violently.

* **Market signal:** When carry trades are being built (risk-on), AUD/JPY and similar pairs trend higher. When they unwind (risk-off), these pairs crash — sometimes 20-30% in weeks.

| Insight: AUD/JPY as a Risk Barometer |
| :---- |
| AUD/JPY is one of the best real-time sentiment gauges in forex. |
| It pairs a high-yield risk currency (AUD) with a low-yield safe haven (JPY). |
| When S\&P 500 drops, AUD/JPY typically drops in tandem. High positive correlation. |
| Monitoring AUD/JPY can give you an early warning of global risk sentiment shifts — before it shows up in other markets. |

## **8.3 Ad Hoc / Unscheduled Events — The Wildcard Factor**

No economic calendar can predict these. But you can prepare frameworks for how they affect markets:

* **Natural disasters:** Can trigger massive government spending (USD-negative long-term via deficit) or repatriation flows (JPY-positive — Japanese insurers bring money home to pay claims).

* **Pandemics (e.g., COVID-19):** Massive risk-off initially → safe havens surge. Then central bank intervention (QE) → eventual risk recovery.

* **Wars / Geopolitical conflict:** Risk-off initially. Commodity-exporting currencies can benefit if the conflict is in a competing producer region.

* **Central bank emergency meetings / surprise decisions:** Massive short-term dislocation. SNB's unpegging of EUR/CHF in 2015 sent CHF up 30% in minutes.

* **Political elections:** Uncertainty before elections \= volatility. Known policy directions after elections \= trend establishment. One of the most predictable trading setups in FA.

# **9\. Intermarket Analysis**

## **9.1 The Four Markets and Their Relationships**

Intermarket analysis studies relationships across currencies, equities, bonds, and commodities. Nothing trades in isolation.

| Relationship | Typical Correlation |
| :---- | :---- |
| USD ↑ → Commodities ↓ | Inverse — commodities priced in USD become more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing demand |
| Oil ↑ → CAD ↑ | Positive — Canada is a major oil exporter |
| Gold ↑ → AUD ↑ | Positive — Australia is a major gold producer |
| S\&P 500 ↑ → JPY ↓ | Inverse — risk-on reduces safe haven demand |
| Bond yields ↑ → USD ↑ | Positive — higher yields attract foreign capital needing USD |
| VIX ↑ → Equity ↓, JPY ↑, Gold ↑ | Fear gauge. Spikes signal risk-off across all markets |
| EM equities ↑ → AUD/NZD ↑ | Positive — EM growth \= commodity demand \= commodity currency strength |

| Insight: Correlations Break During Stress |
| :---- |
| These correlations are tendencies, not laws. During extreme events (2008, COVID-2020), correlations can break or temporarily reverse. |
| In March 2020, even gold sold off initially as panic forced liquidation of ALL assets for USD liquidity. |
| Always check if the intermarket signal confirms your thesis — but don't bet your life on it holding. |
| Correlations are strongest during clear trending regimes and weakest during choppy, uncertain regimes. |

# **10\. Supply, Demand & Exchange Rate Theory**

## **10.1 First Principles**

All exchange rate movements ultimately reduce to supply and demand for a currency. Understanding the fundamental drivers means understanding what creates buying and selling pressure on a currency.

| What INCREASES demand for a currency (→ Appreciation) | What INCREASES supply of a currency (→ Depreciation) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Higher interest rates (carry inflows) | Lower interest rates (carry outflows) |
| Strong economic growth (investment inflows) | Weak growth (capital leaves) |
| Trade surplus (foreign buyers need local currency) | Trade deficit (locals buy foreign goods, sell local currency) |
| Risk-off (safe haven buying) | Risk-on (safe havens sold, riskier assets bought) |
| Central bank intervention (buying own currency) | QE / money printing (flooding supply) |
| Foreign investors buying local bonds/equities | Domestic investors investing abroad |

# **11\. Classifying Economic Indicators**

## **11.1 Leading, Lagging, and Coincident Indicators**

| Type | Definition | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Leading | Predicts future economic activity. Most useful for anticipating moves before they happen. | PMI, Jobless Claims, Consumer Confidence, Yield Curve, Building Permits |
| Coincident | Moves with the economy in real time. Confirms current state. | Industrial Production, Personal Income, Retail Sales, GDP (current) |
| Lagging | Confirms trends after they've occurred. Useful for verifying analysis. | Unemployment Rate, CPI, GDP (past quarters), Prime Rate |

| Insight: Central Banks Use All Three |
| :---- |
| Even lagging indicators matter because the Fed explicitly references them in rate decisions. |
| If the Fed says it's watching unemployment and CPI (both lagging), those lagging indicators become market-moving. |
| The leading indicators tell YOU where the economy is going. The lagging indicators tell you when the FED will act. |
| Trade the gap: use leading indicators to position, and wait for lagging indicators to confirm the Fed's pivot. |

## **11.2 Procyclical vs. Countercyclical Indicators**

| Type | Behaviour |
| :---- | :---- |
| Procyclical (positive correlation) | Moves WITH the economic cycle. Rises during expansion, falls during recession. Example: GDP, employment, corporate earnings, retail sales. |
| Countercyclical (negative correlation) | Moves AGAINST the economic cycle. Rises during recession, falls during expansion. Example: Unemployment rate, government debt, bankruptcy filings. |
| Acyclical | No meaningful relationship to the business cycle. Example: some agricultural data driven by weather rather than economic conditions. |

# **12\. The Fundamental Analyst's Complete Checklist**

## **Before Trading Any Currency Pair, Ask:**

* **Business cycle:** What phase is each country in? Expansion, peak, recession, or recovery?

* **Interest rate differential:** Which central bank is more hawkish? Is the differential widening or narrowing?

* **Inflation:** Is CPI above or below target? Is core inflation trending up or down?

* **Employment:** Is the labour market tightening or loosening? What does the trend in NFP/claims look like?

* **GDP:** Is real GDP accelerating or decelerating? How does it compare to the other country in the pair?

* **Trade balance:** Surplus or deficit? Are capital account inflows offsetting current account deficits?

* **Central bank tone:** Hawkish or dovish? Has the language shifted recently?

* **Risk sentiment:** Is the global environment risk-on or risk-off? How does that affect each currency in the pair?

* **Commodity prices:** If trading AUD, CAD, NZD — what are iron ore, oil, dairy doing?

* **Political stability:** Elections, political crises, policy uncertainty?

| Final Insight: FA is a Thesis, Not a Signal |
| :---- |
| Technical analysis gives you signals. Fundamental analysis gives you a thesis. |
| Your FA thesis tells you WHAT should happen and WHY. Your TA tells you WHEN and WHERE to enter. |
| The most powerful trade setups occur when both agree — FA provides the wind, TA points your sail. |
| Mastering FA takes years. The edge is in the combination: knowing which data matters right now, understanding the narrative, and positioning ahead of the crowd. |
| Professional traders spend more time reading central bank communications than looking at charts. Start there. |
